# Softmax Layer Exercise (with Batch Support & Numerical Stability)

This repository contains a coding exercise for learners to implement a numerically stable **softmax** function in Python using NumPy.  
It was created as part of a Curriculum Engineer assignment.

## 🐳 Docker Commands

To get started, clone this repository and run it inside Docker.

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorothka/ce-softmax.git
cd ce-softmax
```

### 2. Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t ce-softmax .
```

### 3. Run the container
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd)":/workspace ce-softmax
```

Then open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser and launch `softmax_exercise.ipynb`.

## 🎯 Goal
Implement a numerically stable softmax function that works for both a single vector of logits and a batch of logits.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, learners will:  

- **Understand the role of softmax** in neural networks and why it is used to convert raw scores (logits) into probabilities.  
- **Implement the softmax function** in Python using NumPy, both for single vectors (1D arrays) and for batches of data (2D arrays).  
- **Apply numerical stability techniques** by subtracting the maximum logit before exponentiation to prevent overflow errors.  
- **Verify correctness** of the implementation with simple unit tests that check properties like “outputs sum to 1” and “softmax is invariant to constant shifts.”  
- **Practice debugging and testing skills** by interpreting failed tests and fixing implementation mistakes.  
- Build confidence in working with **array operations, broadcasting, and vectorization** in NumPy.

## 📝 Instructions for Learners

Open the notebook `softmax_exercise.ipynb` and complete the function:

```python
def softmax(x: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # your code here
    raise NotImplementedError("Implement the softmax function")
```

Requirements:
- Input can be a **1D NumPy array** `(C,)` or a **2D NumPy array** `(N, C)`.  
- Output should be the same shape, with each row forming a probability distribution that sums to 1.  
- Use the **numerical stability trick** (subtract the max before exponentiation).  
- **Do not modify the input array in place.**

Learners can check their work by running the provided **unit tests**.  
An instructor solution is included at the end of the notebook but would normally be hidden in a course environment.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `softmax_exercise.ipynb` — main exercise notebook (instructions, tests, and solution).  
- `Dockerfile` — container configuration for reproducibility.  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.  
- `README.md` — this file.

## ✅ Notes for Reviewers
- The notebook is cleared of outputs, so learners won’t see results until they run cells themselves.  
- Unit tests provide **clear feedback** if the implementation is incorrect.  
- The instructor solution is separated and labeled, not visible to learners in a real course setting.
